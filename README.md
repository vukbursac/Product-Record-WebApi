# Product-Record-WebApi

Interface to keep a record of your Products created using ASP.NET Web API, Entity Framework and Bootstrap, jQuery libraries, and Partial View. Individual account authorization for better security. You can add a new product with or without selling prices. If you added a Product without selling the price you can do it anytime, you just need to type your new selling price into the input and click on the green button. If you made a profit with that business, the row background color will be light green, and if you lost money it will be light red. You can also delete your product or log out.
